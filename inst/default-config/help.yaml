  gene_selectors: >
    Select genes to visualize and compare
  gene_projection: >
    Manifold model. 
    <br>
    Hover over a metacell to see its top genes and mean inferred age. 
    <br> 
    Click on a metacell to load it to the metacell tab. 
    <br> 
    Double click on a cell type to isolate it, click to add or remove cell types to sub-selection.
  color_proj: >
    You can color the manifold by cell type or by gene expression.  
  top_correlated_select_gene1: >
    A list with the top correlated (and anti-correlated) genes (across metacells) to gene A.
    <br>
    You can select any of them as gene A or gene B. 
  top_correlated_select_gene2: >
    Same for the second gene. 
genes:  
  sidebar_select: >
    Select genes to visualize and compare
  gene_projection: >
    Manifold model. 
    <br>
    Hover over a metacell to see its top genes and mean inferred age. 
    <br> 
    Click on a metacell to load it to the metacell tab. 
    <br> 
    Double click on a cell type to isolate it, click to add or remove cell types to sub-selection.
  color_proj: >
    You can color the manifold by cell type or by gene expression. 
  gene_gene_box: >
    Gene expression of the two selected genes in metacells. 
    <br> 
    Note that axes represent normalized absolute expression levels (log2 scale). 
  # gene_time_box: >
  #   Compare gene expression in metacells over inferred time.
  # vein_box: >
  #   Vein plots describe the continuous transition of cell types to
  #   their direct descendants (represented by diagonal flows spanning
  #   time points), and the dynamic relative frequencies of these cell
  #   types over time (represented by vein width on the Y
  #   axis). 
  # color_gene_vein: >
  #   Select a cell type to view its differentiation dynamics, or
  #   display the expression of either selected gene.
  # vein_gene_foc_type_help: >
  #   Focus on a specific cell type to view its immediate progeny (or progenitor in the case of terminal cell types).
  top_correlated_select_gene1: >
    A list with the top correlated (and anti-correlated) genes (across metacells) to gene A.
    <br>
    You can select any of them as gene A or gene B. 
  top_correlated_select_gene2: >
    Same for the second gene. 
metacells:  
  sidebar_select: >
    Select metacells to visualize and compare
  metacell_projection: >
    Manifold model. 
    <br>
    Click on a metacell to select it for comparison.
    <br> 
    Histograms describe the time distribution of the single cells
    comprising each metacell.
  proj_select_main: > 
    Choose which metacell would be selected on click.
  color_proj_by_selected_mc: > 
    Show selected metacells on the manifold. 
    <br>
    Metacell A would be marked in red and Metacell B would be marked in blue.
  plot_mc_mc_gene_scatter: > 
    Gene expression comparison of the 2 metacells. 
    <br> 
    Colored with red and blue are points with difference > 1.5 (log scale) and p.value < 0.01 (chi^2).
    <br> 
    Clicking on a gene would add it to the temporal dynamic over the metacellâ€™s trajectory plot below.
    <br> 
    Note that axes are in log2 scale. 
  show_diff_expr_table: 
    Toggle for a table of the marked genes. 
  diff_expr_table: 
    Click on a gene to add it to the trajectory plots below, and mark it in green in the scatter plot above. 
  # plot_mc_traj:
  #   Temporal dynamics of genes over the metacell trajectory in inferred time. 
  # traj_genes_help: 
  #   Add genes to be plotted below. 
  # traj_metacell: 
  #   Toggle between plotting the trajectory of metacell A and metacell B.     
  # flow_plot: >
  #   Predicted flow leading up to the selected metacell. In this representation, metacells are depicted as nodes
  #   distributed horizontally over time, and edges denote their predicted transition to the next time point.
  # flow_metacell: >
  #   Choose which metacell to plot.
