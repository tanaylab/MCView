# MCView

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

MCView creates a shiny-app facilitating interactive exploration and
annotation of metacell models. Metacell itself is described
[here](https://pypi.org/project/metacells/). You can also explore an
example of MCV output for [Mouse
organogenesis](https://apps.tanaylab.com/MCV/mm_gastru/) on the Tanay
group server.

## Installation

Install the latest github release:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tanaylab/MCView", ref = remotes::github_release())
```

Or install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tanaylab/MCView")
```

## Usage

See the
[vignette](https://tanaylab.github.io/MCView/articles/MCView.html).

Tl;dr:

#### Import a dataset:

``` r
MCView::import_dataset(project = "PBMC",                
               anndata_file = "raw/metacells.h5ad")
```

> Note: since version 0.2.7, MCView only supports files that were
> generated by the new metacells version (\>= 0.9). If you have an old
> file, you can convert it using
> [this](https://github.com/tanaylab/metacells/blob/master/bin/convert_0.8_to_0.9.py)
> script.

#### Run the app:

You can run the app from R using:

``` r
MCView::run_app("PBMC", launch.browser = TRUE)
```

Or from shell:
